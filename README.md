# Name-Entity-Recognition-Project

This is a project I worked on during my last quarter of my master's program at UCSD.

The first method (RNN) achieved an F1 score of 0.80 on an unseen test set. 
The second method is a custom multi-layer NN achieved an F1 score of 0.78. 

The picture I have linked has more details.
